# hello-world

Hello All, hello my friends, hello Maddy,

This is my first-ever repository
Yesterday Andrew asked Maddy and me to learn the ropes of Git, investigate it and practice it a bit.
So that is what I am doing right now.
So far so good

Making my first changes to the Master branch.

I am now testing the changes making sure that they are saving correctly locally.

With Maddy we are now testing how the changes are being implemented.
